# Exercise: Stylish Navigation
## Part A - Use styles to create a navigation bar in the provided files

We're trying to go from this:

!

to this:

!

***Do this by changing only the CSS, not the HTML.***

|Note|
|:----|
|You may find it interesting to look at the content of the pages provided.  The pages use some of the new features of HTML5 and CSS-3|

### Instructions
1. Download the [startup files provided here](stylish-nav-start.zip).
2. Read and complete the tutorial at: http://css.maxdesign.com.au/floatutorial/tutorial0601.htm

|Note|
|:----|
|To do this, you will only modify the **styles.css** file; ***do not*** alter the HTML in the other documents.|

3. You will have to make your buttons a little wider to fit the text.  Try changing the width property of the "**ul#navlist li a**" rule to be a little wider than 5em.
4. Save the files for this part; you’ll submit them at the end.

## Part B - Create a Tab Bar navigation system for your project 

!

|Note|
|:----|
|You are *not* required to use this navigation system in the final version of your project.|

The following brief tutorials show you how to create a tab bar navigation system from an unordered list.  To do so, you’ll be reviewing the following tutorials online:
- http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listamatic/horizontal01.htm
- http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listamatic/horizontal02.htm
- http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listamatic/horizontal03.htm
- http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listamatic/horizontal05.htm

### Instructions

1. Complete the tutorials, and re-create lists 1, 2, 3 and 5 that are linked above in 4 separate web pages. Replace "Item 1", "Item 2", etc., with category names related to your project or interests.  (In other words, you will create four pages with identical content, as placeholders.  Each page will display a different variation on the "tab" metaphor.)  *Do Not* use Item 1, Item 2, etc., as shown in the example above.
2. As in Part A, save these files for submission.
