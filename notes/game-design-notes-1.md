# Game Design Notes - Part I

## I. What is a game?
Here are two attempts at a definition that we like:
- Playing a game is "the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles" - Bernard Suits --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusory_attitude
- "A game is a series of interesting decisions." - Sid Meier - his 2012 GDC talk about this is here --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WggIdtrqgKg

## II. 
- Risk v. Reward
- Feedback Loops
- New player onboarding
- Find the fun


## III. Characteristics of Interesting Decisions
- Tradeoffs - ex. *buy a sword or a healing potion?*
- Situational - make decisions dependent on the current game situation
- Personal - the player can express their particular playing style - *conservative*, *aggressive*, *strategic*
- Persistence - the decision effects the game for a period of time

## IV. Type of Decision
- Risk v. Reward
