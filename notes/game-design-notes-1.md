# Game Design Notes - Part I

## I. What is a game?
Here are two attempts at a definition that we like:
- Playing a game is "the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles" - Bernard Suits --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusory_attitude
- "A game is a series of interesting decisions." - Sid Meier - his 2012 GDC talk about this is here --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WggIdtrqgKg

## II. 
- Risk v. Reward
- Feedback Loops
- New player onboarding
