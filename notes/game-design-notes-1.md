# Game Design Notes - Part I

## I. What is a game?
Here are two attempts at a definition that we like:
- Playing a game is "the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles" - Bernard Suits --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusory_attitude
- "A game is a series of interesting decisions." - Sid Meier - his 2012 GDC talk about this is here --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WggIdtrqgKg

## II. 
- Risk v. Reward
- Feedback Loops
- New player onboarding
- Find the fun


## III. Characteristics of Interesting Decisions
- Tradeoffs - ex. *buy a sword or a healing potion?*
- Situational - make decisions dependent on the current game situation
- Personal - the player can express their particular playing style - *conservative* v. *aggressive*, *offensive v. defensive*
- Persistence - the decision effects the game for a period of time

## IV. Types of Decision
- Risk v. Reward
- Short Term v. Long Term
- Play Style and Personality
- Multiple goals: short term, medium term, long term, meta goals
  - going for high score, try to get achievements, trying to beat a particular level, trying to survive as long as possible on hard
- Customization - let players get invested in game in a way that reflects their personality or play style ex. color of car, name of hero, weapon
