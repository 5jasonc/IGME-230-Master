# Using PHP to detect the HTTP User-Agent string

## I. Overview
- in software development, a **user agent** is software that acts on behalf of a user. In the HTTP protocol, a user agent is a client application that submits HTTP requests. Examples of HTTP clients include web browsers, 'bots such as search engine web crawlers, and apps that consume HTTP services (weather, stock quotes, etc)
- in HTTP, the client sents a **user-agent string** that contains a list of keywords and comments that are designed to communicate the client's capabilities to the server. For example, the User-Agent string might be used by a web server to choose variants based on the known capabilities of a particular version of client software. ex. A "flip phone" would not receive a web site's images and CSS style sheets.
- The user-agent string includes:
  - the application type
  - operating system
  - software vendor or software version
- in HTTP, this information is sent by the client as a HTTP *request header*
- here are some sample user agent strings
